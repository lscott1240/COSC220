*** Sorted Single Linked List ***
*********************************

We are going to implement a sorted single linked list by student's ID number.  You need to divide your program into three files :
    - Link.h
    - LinkFun.cpp
    - LinkedList.cpp
    
Node structure :
    - char lastName[20]
    - char firstName[20]
    - int idNumber
    - Node * next

Function prototypes :
   Node * createNode() : 
        - Create a new node with "new" operator. Get student data from keyboard and assign to members of the Node.
        
   Node * insertNode (Node *, Node *) :
        - Insert a new node to the linked list sorted by student's ID number. If a new node ID is already in the list, it must be recognized
          and inform to the user "This student is already in the list".
        
   Node * searchNode (Node *) :
        - Search a node by student ID number, if there is no match, return NULL pointer.
 
   Node * deleteNode (Node *, int)
         - Delete a node from the list.  If there is no matched id for delete, write a message and do nothing.
   
   void printList (Node *)
         - Display all the students' information in the list ( For empty list, display "empty list" )
         
In LinkedList.cpp create a menu function as well as a validation function that checks user input and displays the following :
    - 1. Insert a node
    - 2. Delete a node
    - 3. Print list
    - 4. Search a node - search a node and print information for a student
    - 5. Quit the program
