**** Grocery Receipt System ****
********************************

We are going to build a grocery receipt system.
There is a diverse selection of items to sell in our grocery store.  All item's information are in the file named "item.txt" which will be provided.
Each item has an item number, an item name, taxability, a selling type, and a unit price.  The data formats "for item.txt" are as follows.

34    Vegetable_2   n   p   1.99
56    Coffe_a       t   s   5.99
78    Fruit_3       n   n   0.33

Item number, item name, taxability, selling type, and unit price.

Objective : 
  - Build a program that reads from the input file "item.txt" and prompts user to enter item id and quantity of the item they would like to order.
      - Note : 
          - Item type 'p' or 'n' should prompt the user to enter how many pounds or units ( quantity ) they would like respectively.
          - Item type 's' should not prompt the user for quantity     
          - Taxability used in this program is 6 % (This is not important and can be changed )
          
  - Write a menu function that provides the user with the following options :
      - 1. Order an item
      - 2. Quit the program
  
  - The output of this program should be written to a text file named "YourLastName_FirstName.txt"

Notes : 
  - Do not use a class
  - Open input file only once for creating an output file
  - Do not create local space to save all information from the input file in your program
